"""
Deprecated: this Django form has been removed because the project was migrated to Flask.
The Flask app now handles contact submissions via a plain HTML form and the route
`main.contact` in the Flask blueprint. This file is kept as a stub for history.

If you want a Flask form wrapper, use Flask-WTF to recreate form validation.
